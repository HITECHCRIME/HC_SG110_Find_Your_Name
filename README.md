## Lyrics

```

every day i try to find your name
every day a plane aflight already with your craze
you know
gotta let you down
youâ€™d do the same in my place
yaah
all my reckless help in vain
(you need me) such a farce 
but i'm supposed to stay fierce 
need no fuss so fuck your plates 
i'm so done for days
i'm so done for days
tried to find your name
true name

single point of view so sustained

gettin
the racking
on whim so drop this
hear that a lot now off miss
missing on purpose get this 
making a point but it usually (ain't) breakin
some never wise enough
to give up their stance
their true name
to be on a name to (blank) name basis (too blank to be on a name to name basis)
with their self

so drop hiss




name

```
