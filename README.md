## Lyrics

```
every day i try to find your name
every day a plane aflight already with your craze
you know
gotta let you down
youâ€™d do the same in my place
yaah
all my reckless help in vain
(you need me) such a farce 
but i'm supposed to stay fierce 
need no fuss fuck your plates 
i was done for days
i'm so done for days
i tried to find your name (true name)

single point of view so sustained
such mistake ey hiss

gettin
the racking
on whim so drop this
hear that a lot now off miss
missing on purpose get this 
making a point but it usually (ain't) breakin
some never wise enough
to give up their stance
their true name
to be on a name to (blank) name basis               /// (too blank to be on a name to name basis)
with their self
gettin                                              /// selling 
the racking                                         /// self-respecting
on whim so drop this                                /// you gonna laugh that off mate
hear that a lot now off miss                        /// gives my missing purpose
missing on purpose get this (so darkness)           /// stay here, while i search for
give up their stance                                /// human nature in the darkness missing
their true name                                     /// true name of the sun
to be on a name to (blank) name basis               /// (too blank to be on a name to name basis)
with their self
with the sun

so drop the hiss
your true name
