## Lyrics

```

every day i try to find your name
every day a plane aflight already with your craze
you know
gotta let you down
youâ€™d do the same in my place

all my reckless help gin vain
you need me such a farce 
but i'm supposed to stay fierce 
need no fuss so fuck your plates 
so i'm done for days

single point of view so sustained


name

```
